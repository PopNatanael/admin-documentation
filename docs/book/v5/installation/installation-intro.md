# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will install Dotkernel Admin from scratch.
We will focus on these tasks:

- Highlight 3rd party tools required for the installation.
- Provide all the relevant commands with expected responses.
- Configure the development environment.
- Run the project.

By the end of this tutorial you will have a fully-functional Dotkernel Admin on your selected environment and can begin coding.
