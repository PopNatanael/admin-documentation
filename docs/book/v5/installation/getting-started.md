# Clone the project

## Recommended development environment

> If you are using Windows as OS on your machine, you can use WSL2 as development environment.

Using your terminal, navigate inside the directory you want to download the project files into.
Make sure that the directory is empty before proceeding to the download process.
Once there, run the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dotkernel/admin.git .
```

If everything ran correctly, you can expect to see an output like this, though the numbers may differ.

```shell
Cloning into '.'...

You can already open the project in your preferred IDE to double-check the files were copied correctly.
