# Manage GeoLite2 database

You can download/update a specific GeoLite2 database, by running the following command:

    php bin/cli.php geoip:synchronize -d {DATABASE}

Where _{DATABASE}_ takes one of the following values: `asn`, `city`, `country`.

You can download/update all GeoLite2 databases at once, by running the following command:

    php bin/cli.php geoip:synchronize

The output should be similar to the below, displaying per
row: `database identifier`: `previous build datetime` -> `current build datetime`.

> asn: n/a -> 2021-07-01 02:09:34
>
> city: n/a -> 2021-07-01 02:09:20
>
> country: n/a -> 2021-07-01 02:05:12

Get help for this command by running:

    php bin/cli.php help geoip:synchronize

**Tip**: If you setup the synchronizer command as a cronjob, you can add the `-q|--quiet` option, and it will output
data only if an error has occurred.
